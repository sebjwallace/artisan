GUI for CSS development

A while ago I built a crude prototype of a WYSIWYG that provided a GUI for CSS. I found that it speed up my development time and made building my UI & UX far more natural and intuitive.

This repo is aimed to build that prototype into a usable application using <a href="https://github.com/sebjwallace/RSS" target="_blank">RSS</a> as the driver, FLUX as an architecture and React as the view.

To get an idea of what Artisan is about, check out this <a href="http://sebjwallace.com/blog/artisan-building-a-wysiwyg-css-editor/" target="_blank">post</a> and the clip below.
